## 🕹️ Synopsis

**The Streamer’s Curse** is a first-person horror game inspired by the world of livestreaming and digital urban legends.  
You play as **Jsierra**, a streamer who recently surpassed his former friend and rival **Ste300** in popularity and followers.

But during his celebration stream, something goes terribly wrong: the broadcast glitches, the chat floods with impossible messages, and a distorted pixelated figure begins whispering from the shadows of the feed…

The cursed echo of Ste300 drags him into a **virtual limbo**, a corrupted world between servers and memories, where fragments of his career twist into glitches and darkness.  
His only hope: **collect the 7 Cursed Twitch Bits** and donate them to the spectral channel… before Ste300’s entity finds him.
